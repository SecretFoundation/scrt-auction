Flare is a design system for front-end agile engineering.

Flare describes any application front-end using four simple concepts: layouts, pages, frames and blocks. This abstraction layer shapes a common language between definition and implementation teams.

With Flare, analysts, designers and stakeholders can prototype a full-blown application in seconds sharing wireframes, mock-ups or code with coders and testers in a continuous cycle for a true agile experience.
